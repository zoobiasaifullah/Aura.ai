# GitHub Pages Deployment Fix

## ❌ Error: Pages Deployment Failed (404)

The deployment is failing because GitHub Pages settings need to be reconfigured.

## 🔧 Fix Steps:

### Step 1: Check GitHub Pages Settings

1. **Go to your repository settings**:
   https://github.com/zoobiasaifullah/Aura.ai/settings/pages

2. **Configure GitHub Pages**:
   - **Source**: Select "GitHub Actions" (if available)
   - **OR** Select "Deploy from a branch"
   - **Branch**: `main`
   - **Folder**: `/docs`
   - Click **Save**

### Step 2: Verify docs Folder

Your `docs` folder should contain:
- ✅ index.html
- ✅ styles.css
- ✅ main.js
- ✅ images/
- ✅ robots.txt
- ✅ sitemap.xml

### Step 3: Check GitHub Actions Workflow

If you have a `.github/workflows/` folder, check if there's a pages deployment workflow that needs updating.

## 🎯 Quick Fix Option:

If GitHub Actions is causing issues, switch to the simpler "Deploy from branch" method:

1. Go to: https://github.com/zoobiasaifullah/Aura.ai/settings/pages
2. Under "Build and deployment":
   - **Source**: Deploy from a branch
   - **Branch**: main
   - **Folder**: /docs
3. Click **Save**
4. Wait 1-2 minutes
5. Your site will be live at: https://zoobiasaifullah.github.io/Aura.ai/

## 📋 Current Status:

- ✅ Repository: Clean and pushed
- ✅ docs/ folder: Contains all site files
- ❌ GitHub Pages: Needs configuration
- 🌐 Target URL: https://zoobiasaifullah.github.io/Aura.ai/

## 🚀 After Configuration:

Once you save the settings, GitHub will automatically deploy your site from the `/docs` folder. You'll see a green checkmark in the "Actions" tab when it's done.

**Would you like me to check if you have a GitHub Actions workflow file that needs to be removed?**
