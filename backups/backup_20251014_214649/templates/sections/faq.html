                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Simply upload a clear selfie and our AI analyzes your skin using advanced computer vision and dermatology-backed algorithms. It identifies your skin type, texture, problem areas, and specific concerns like acne, dryness, or sensitivity. The entire analysis takes just seconds and is completely private—your photos are encrypted and never shared.</p>

                    <span>Why only 2-3 products? Isn't more better?</span>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Actually, no! Most people use way too many products, which can irritate skin and waste money. Your skin needs just a few high-quality essentials that work together effectively. Our minimalist approach focuses on what truly matters: cleanse, treat, and protect. Simple, effective, and backed by dermatology science.</p>

Our AI learns and adapts to give you better recommendations. Plus, with Aura Plus, you get monthly check-ins and routine adjustments to ensure continuous improvement.</p>
