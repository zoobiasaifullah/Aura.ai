                    <span>How does the AI skin analysis work?</span>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Simply upload a clear selfie and our AI analyzes your skin using advanced computer vision and dermatology-backed algorithms. It identifies your skin type, texture, problem areas, and specific concerns like acne, dryness, or sensitivity.</p>
                    <p>The AI examines over 100 different facial features including pore size, fine lines, pigmentation patterns, redness levels, and hydration indicators. It then cross-references these findings with a database of thousands of dermatology cases to provide accurate, personalized insights.</p>
                    <p>The entire analysis takes just seconds and is completely private—your photos are encrypted end-to-end and never shared with third parties.</p>

                    <span>Why only 2-3 products? Isn't more better?</span>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Actually, no! Most people use way too many products, which can irritate skin, disrupt the skin barrier, and waste money on unnecessary steps. Your skin needs just a few high-quality essentials that work together effectively.</p>
                    <p>Our minimalist approach is grounded in dermatology research showing that simpler routines often produce better results. We focus on what truly matters: cleanse (remove dirt and impurities), treat (address specific concerns with targeted actives), and protect (shield from environmental damage).</p>
                    <p>By eliminating redundant products and potential irritants, your skin can focus on healing and maintaining balance. Simple, effective, and backed by science—not marketing hype.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Every product in our catalog goes through a rigorous 5-step vetting process by our team of skincare experts and dermatology consultants. We evaluate ingredient quality, clinical evidence, brand reputation, user reviews, and manufacturing standards.</p>
                    <p>We prioritize ingredient transparency, proven efficacy, safety profiles, and ethical sourcing. Products must meet strict criteria: no harmful additives, clear ingredient lists, third-party testing, and demonstrated results in clinical or real-world use.</p>
                    <p>Our AI then matches you with products that fit your specific skin type, concerns, budget, ingredient preferences, and any sensitivities or allergies. You'll only see options that are right for YOUR unique skin—never generic recommendations.</p>

                    <span>Is the skin analysis really free?</span>
                    <i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i>
                </button>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Yes, completely free! Upload your selfie, take the 2-minute quiz, and get your personalized routine recommendation at no cost. No credit card required, no hidden fees, no trial period that converts to paid. We believe everyone deserves access to personalized skincare recommendations, so the analysis is always free.</p>
                    <p>Our mission is to democratize skincare expertise. While dermatologist consultations can cost hundreds of dollars, we're making professional-grade skin analysis accessible to everyone regardless of budget. You'll receive the same quality insights and product recommendations whether you're a free user or subscribe to Aura Plus.</p>
                    <p>We're able to offer this because we focus on providing genuine value first. Some users love the free analysis so much they choose to upgrade to Aura Plus for ongoing support, tracking, and adjustments—but that's always optional, never required.</p>

                    <span>Can I see all the ingredients before buying?</span>
                    <i class="fas fa-chevron-down"></i>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Absolutely! Ingredient transparency is one of our core values and a key part of what makes Aura different. Every product recommendation shows the complete ingredient list with detailed explanations of what each ingredient does and why it's included in the formulation.</p>
                    <p>You'll see information about active ingredients (the ones that treat specific concerns), inactive ingredients (preservatives, stabilizers, texture enhancers), potential allergens, and any common irritants. We also flag ingredients that may be problematic for certain skin types or conditions.</p>
                    <p>No mystery chemicals, no hidden additives, no greenwashing—just total clarity about what you're putting on your skin so you can make informed decisions.</p>

                    <span>What if the recommended products don't work for me?</span>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Skin is unique and sometimes needs adjustments—that's completely normal! Skincare is not one-size-fits-all, and factors like weather changes, hormones, stress, and lifestyle can all affect how your skin responds to products.</p>
                    <p>If you're not seeing the results you expected or experience any irritation, you can easily retake the quiz or upload a new selfie to update your skin analysis at any time. Our AI learns from your feedback and adapts to provide more accurate recommendations based on your experiences.</p>
                    <p>We recommend giving any new routine at least 4-6 weeks for your skin to adjust and show improvements, as that's typically how long it takes for cell turnover. However, if you notice immediate irritation or worsening concerns, update your profile right away.</p>
                    <p>With Aura Plus, you get monthly check-ins where we track your progress, ask about your experience, and fine-tune your routine for continuous improvement. Think of it as having a skincare coach who adjusts your plan as your skin evolves.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Not at all! Your personalized routine recommendations are completely free, and you can purchase the products wherever you prefer—whether that's your local drugstore, favorite online retailer, or directly from the brand. We're here to guide you, not lock you into any purchase platform.</p>
                    <p>That said, we do offer convenient affiliate links to trusted retailers like Amazon, Sephora, Ulta, and brand websites for your recommended products. These links help support Aura at no extra cost to you, and we only partner with reputable sellers to ensure you receive authentic products.</p>
                    <p>Our recommendations include product names, brands, and full ingredient lists so you can easily find them anywhere. Some users prefer shopping through our links for convenience and to support our mission, while others shop around for the best prices—both are perfectly fine!</p>
                    <p>We're compensated through affiliate partnerships when you purchase through our links, which helps us keep the skin analysis free for everyone. But our product recommendations are never influenced by commissions—we only recommend what's truly best for your skin.</p>
