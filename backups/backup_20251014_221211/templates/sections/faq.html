                    <span>How does the AI skin analysis work?</span>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Simply upload a clear selfie and our AI analyzes your skin using advanced computer vision and dermatology-backed algorithms. It identifies your skin type, texture, problem areas, and specific concerns like acne, dryness, or sensitivity.</p>
                    <p>The AI examines over 100 different facial features including pore size, fine lines, pigmentation patterns, redness levels, and hydration indicators. It then cross-references these findings with a database of thousands of dermatology cases to provide accurate, personalized insights.</p>
                    <p>The entire analysis takes just seconds and is completely private—your photos are encrypted end-to-end and never shared with third parties.</p>

                    <span>Why only 2-3 products? Isn't more better?</span>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Actually, no! Most people use way too many products, which can irritate skin, disrupt the skin barrier, and waste money on unnecessary steps. Your skin needs just a few high-quality essentials that work together effectively.</p>
                    <p>Our minimalist approach is grounded in dermatology research showing that simpler routines often produce better results. We focus on what truly matters: cleanse (remove dirt and impurities), treat (address specific concerns with targeted actives), and protect (shield from environmental damage).</p>
                    <p>By eliminating redundant products and potential irritants, your skin can focus on healing and maintaining balance. Simple, effective, and backed by science—not marketing hype.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Every product in our catalog goes through a rigorous 5-step vetting process by our team of skincare experts and dermatology consultants. We evaluate ingredient quality, clinical evidence, brand reputation, user reviews, and manufacturing standards.</p>
                    <p>We prioritize ingredient transparency, proven efficacy, safety profiles, and ethical sourcing. Products must meet strict criteria: no harmful additives, clear ingredient lists, third-party testing, and demonstrated results in clinical or real-world use.</p>
                    <p>Our AI then matches you with products that fit your specific skin type, concerns, budget, ingredient preferences, and any sensitivities or allergies. You'll only see options that are right for YOUR unique skin—never generic recommendations.</p>

                    <span>Can I see all the ingredients before buying?</span>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Absolutely! Ingredient transparency is one of our core values and a key part of what makes Aura different. Every product recommendation shows the complete ingredient list with detailed explanations of what each ingredient does and why it's included in the formulation.</p>
                    <p>You'll see information about active ingredients (the ones that treat specific concerns), inactive ingredients (preservatives, stabilizers, texture enhancers), potential allergens, and any common irritants. We also flag ingredients that may be problematic for certain skin types or conditions.</p>
                    <p>No mystery chemicals, no hidden additives, no greenwashing—just total clarity about what you're putting on your skin so you can make informed decisions.</p>

                    <p>Skin is unique and sometimes needs adjustments! If you're not seeing results or experience any issues, you can retake the quiz or update your skin analysis. Our AI learns and adapts to give you better recommendations. Plus, with Aura Plus, you get monthly check-ins and routine adjustments to ensure continuous improvement.</p>
