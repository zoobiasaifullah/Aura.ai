# ✅ Updated Shopify Integration - Status

## 🎯 What Changed

I've updated the integration to work with your **existing "Your Path to Perfect Skin in 3 Simple Steps"** section instead of creating new pricing cards.

### Changes Made:

1. **Updated Service Pricing:**
   - ✅ AI Skin Analysis: **$20** (one-time payment)
   - ✅ Personalized Quiz: **First time free, then $5/month**
   - ✅ Complete Routine: **$50** (complete package)

2. **Added Shopify Buy Buttons** to each service card in the 3-step section

3. **Connected "Get Your Routine" navbar button** to trigger the Complete Routine Shopify Buy Button

4. **Removed the separate pricing section** I created earlier

## 🔧 Next Steps (Your Action Required)

### Step 1: Create Products in Shopify

Login to: https://admin.shopify.com/store/aura-aii

**Product 1: AI Skin Analysis Service**
- Title: `AI Skin Analysis Service`
- Price: **$20.00** (one-time)
- Product type: `Digital Service`
- Tags: `digital-service, analysis, ai`

**Product 2: Personalized Skincare Quiz (SUBSCRIPTION)**
- Title: `Personalized Skincare Quiz`
- Price: **$5.00** per month
- ⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** Set this as a **subscription product**
  - In Shopify admin, go to Settings → Apps → Install "Subscriptions by Shopify" app
  - When creating the product, enable "Subscription" option
  - Set billing frequency: Monthly
  - First order: Free (use discount or special setup)
- Product type: `Digital Service`
- Tags: `digital-service, quiz, subscription, monthly`

**Product 3: Complete Personalized Routine**
- Title: `Complete Personalized Routine`
- Price: **$50.00** (one-time)
- Product type: `Digital Service`
- Tags: `digital-service, complete, routine, featured`

### Step 2: Get Storefront Access Token

1. Shopify Admin → **Settings** → **Apps and sales channels**
2. Click **Develop apps** → **Create an app**
   - App name: `Aura Website Integration`
3. Click **Configure Storefront API scopes**
4. Enable:
   - `unauthenticated_read_product_listings`
   - `unauthenticated_read_checkouts`
   - `unauthenticated_write_checkouts`
5. **Save** → **Install app**
6. Copy the **Storefront API access token**

### Step 3: Get Product IDs

After creating products:
1. Go to **Products** in Shopify admin
2. Click on each product
3. Copy the ID from the URL: `https://admin.shopify.com/store/aura-aii/products/8573291045`
   - The number `8573291045` is the Product ID

### Step 4: Update JavaScript File

Open: `static/js/shopify-buy-buttons.js`

**Line 33** - Replace with your token:
```javascript
storefrontAccessToken: 'YOUR_STOREFRONT_ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE'
```

**Line 43** - Replace with AI Analysis Product ID:
```javascript
createBuyButton(ui, 'AI_SKIN_ANALYSIS_PRODUCT_ID', 'shopify-buy-button-analysis', {
```

**Line 87** - Replace with Quiz Product ID:
```javascript
createBuyButton(ui, 'PERSONALIZED_QUIZ_PRODUCT_ID', 'shopify-buy-button-quiz', {
```

**Line 127** - Replace with Complete Routine Product ID:
```javascript
createBuyButton(ui, 'COMPLETE_ROUTINE_PRODUCT_ID', 'shopify-buy-button-routine', {
```

### Step 5: Rebuild & Deploy

```powershell
python build.py
git add -A
git commit -m "Add Shopify product IDs and access token"
git push origin main
```

## 🎨 How It Works Now

### On the Homepage:
1. User scrolls to "Your Path to Perfect Skin" section
2. Sees 3 service cards with pricing:
   - AI Analysis ($20)
   - Quiz (First free, then $5/mo)
   - Complete Routine ($50)
3. Each card has a Shopify Buy Button
4. Clicking a button opens Shopify checkout overlay

### In the Navigation:
1. User clicks "Get Your Routine" in top navbar
2. Automatically triggers the Complete Routine ($50) Buy Button
3. Opens Shopify checkout for the full package

## 📝 Setting Up the Quiz Subscription

For the **"First time free, then $5/month"** quiz:

### Option 1: Using Shopify Subscriptions App
1. Install "Subscriptions by Shopify" (free app)
2. Create subscription product with $5/month pricing
3. Set up a free trial period (1 month free)
4. First customers get 1 free analysis, then charged monthly

### Option 2: Using Two Products
1. **Product A:** "Quiz - First Time" ($0.00)
2. **Product B:** "Quiz - Monthly Subscription" ($5.00/month)
3. Update the Buy Button to show Product A for first-time customers
4. Send follow-up email with subscription link for Product B

### Option 3: Using Discount Code
1. Create quiz product at $5.00/month subscription
2. Create discount code: `FIRSTFREE` (100% off first order)
3. Auto-apply the code for new customers
4. They pay $0 first month, then $5/month after

I recommend **Option 1** (Subscriptions app) as it's the cleanest solution.
