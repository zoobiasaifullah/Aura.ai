# üîç Finding Your Admin API Token

After enabling the API in the App Development section, here's how to get the token:

## Look for These Sections:

### 1. Admin API Access Token Section
After you clicked "Install app" or enabled the API, you should see:
- **"Admin API access token"** heading
- A button that says **"Reveal token once"** or shows a token value

### 2. If You See "Reveal token once":
- Click that button
- Copy the ENTIRE token (it's long, like: shpat_abc123def456...)
- Save it somewhere temporarily (Notepad)
- **IMPORTANT:** You can only see this token ONCE!

### 3. If You Don't See the Token:
You might need to:
1. Look for **"API credentials"** tab at the top
2. Or scroll down to find the **"Admin API access token"** section
3. Or the token might already be revealed - look for a long string starting with `shpat_`

---

## What the Token Looks Like:
```
shpat_1234567890abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890
```

It starts with `shpat_` and is about 32-40 characters long.
